# CLKBrain

CLKBrain is a machine learning tool intended to replace the need to employ software developers by automatically selecting and optimizing the best machine learning network for any given task. It provides a simple web interface to the end user.

## Overview

CLKBrain is built using Python and consists of several components:

- `core.py`: Contains the core functionality of CLKBrain, including network selection, optimization, training, and prediction.
- `web_interface.py`: Provides a web interface for interacting with CLKBrain.
- `data_processing.py`: Implements data processing functionality for CLKBrain.
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the interaction between different components of CLKBrain.

## Installation
